# Bitcoin Mining, Energy, & the Environment with Margot Paez - Atlanta BitDevs Socratic Seminar
The [Atlanta BitDevs](https://atlantabitdevs.org/) is a place for free and open Bitcoin education in Atlanta. 
Discussions are open to people of all skill levels.

Join the community and #LearnBitcoinTogether as Atlanta BitDevs Comes to NCR for the next Socratic Seminar!

## Overview
This installment of the Atlanta BitDevs will discuss the latest technological developments in Bitcoin and Lightning!

For this month's socratic seminar, we'll have a discussion about bitcoin mining, energy, and the environment. This topic concerns a lot of people but is very frequently misunderstood. That's why we're bringing in bitcoiner and climate scientist Margot Paez to help us make sense of it. She is a fellow at the Bitcoin Policy Institute and a doctoral candidate at the Georgia Institute of Technology.

After the event, we'll migrate down the street to a restaurant for food and drinks.
