# Intro
What are NCR Crypto meetups? How do I participate? What is a blockchain? What is a cryptocurrency? How do they work (generally, non-technical)? Why do they matter? What is their use? Etc.

## Overview
 We will provide context and details on how you can participate in future meetup topics, process for doing so and resources at your disposal. In addition, we will be covering the broad topic of blockchains and cryptocurrencies, so attendees can start with a strong foundation of the topic, which we will build upon in later meetups. The goal is to present 20-30 minutes and leave the remainder of the hour for questions, so be sure to bring all your questions!
