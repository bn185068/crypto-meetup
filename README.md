### Meetup Types
1. Education & Discussion - These meetups will be knowledge focused for anyone to learn about a topic. Content will be less technical and catered to higher level ideas. Format is a 20-30 min presentation followed by Q&A + discussion.
2. Innovation & Collaboration - These meetups are meant to be like a shark tank. We will allow anyone a 5 minute max to pitch ideas to the group and open it up to a 5 minute Q&A and discussion meant to "sharpen" the ideas and value propositions presented in the pitch. The focus is more on crypto and blockchain IP.
3. Socratic - These meetups will be more technical in nature (although they don't have to be). In a typical socratic session, a moderator will send out some reading material beforehand that participants are required to at least have read at a high level. The moderator will do a quick, high level type of presenatation on the highlights of the reading materaial and then a platform for discussion is opened up to the whole group. Definition of a socratic seminar/discussion:

```text
A Socratic seminar is a type of formal group discussion based on the learning and teaching methods employed by Socrates, an ancient Greek philosopher often credited with founding Western philosophy. It is based more on inquiry and discussion. Socrates held the idea that it is more effective to help participants think for themselves than it is to simply give them information. A Socratic seminar is, therefore, intended to be a discussion of a specific topic among all of those present rather than a situation in which one teacher gives information to students.
