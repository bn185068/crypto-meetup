# NCR Crypto Meetups
This is a collection of blockchain crypto code examples, documents, demos and schedule for our blockchain crypto meetup!

### Schedule
You can view the up coming schedule [here](./schedule.md). If you would like to be added to the schedule please open up a PR with the linked table filled out! Then when it gets merged in it will be considered to be in the books.

### Meeting folders
Before or after the scheduled meetup you are encouraged to drop in any supporting materials like slides, demos or diagrams that were used during the meetup for later review or code along sessions with the people attending! A link to the recording can be added to the schedule later.
