## Meetup Types

1. Education

   - Learn & Discuss is the theme.
   - Education meetups will be knowledge focused for anyone to learn about a topic.
   - Content will be less technical and catered to higher level ideas.
   - Format is a 20-30 minute presentation followed by Q&A and discussions.

2. Innovation

   - Collaboration and ideation is the theme.
   - These meetups are meant to be like a shark tank.
   - We will allow anyone 5 minutes max to pitch ideas to the group and open it up to a 5 minute Q&A and discussion meant to sharpen the ideas and value propositions presented in the pitch.
   - The focus of the ideas should revolve around crypto and blockchain based ideas, especially as it relates to NCR customers.
   - A form will be sent out in advance to collect and rate ideas for pitching.
   - If your idea is chosen, you will be contacted to organize a pitch presentation.

3. Socratic

   - Critical thinking & healthy debate is the theme.
   - These meetups are typically a little more technical in nature (although they don't have to be).
   - In a typical socratic session, a moderator will send out some reading material that participants are required to read beforehand.
   - Attendees should formulate questions and thought provoking discussion points for the group.
   - The idea is to generate a fact based discussion to drive us closer to the "truth" of the topic and help each other gain a more in-depth understanding of the topic.
   - The moderator will give a quick, high level presenatation on the highlights of the reading material.
   - A platform for discussion is opened up to the whole group for questions, debate, discussion, etc.
   - For reference, here is a definition of a socratic seminar:
       > A Socratic seminar is a type of formal group discussion based on the learning and teaching methods employed by Socrates, an
       > ancient Greek philosopher often credited with founding Western philosophy. It is based more on inquiry and discussion. Socrates
       > held the idea that it is more effective to help participants think for themselves than it is to simply give them information. A
       > Socratic seminar is, therefore, intended to be a discussion of a specific topic among all of those present rather than a
       > situation in which one teacher gives information to students.
