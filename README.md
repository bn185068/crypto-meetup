*Meetup: an informal meeting or get-together.* These meetups are meant to be  Informal, casual and fun. Anyone can join, and there is only 1 Participation Requirement: a desire to learn! All questions are encouraged and expected. All levels of knowledge from all organizations within NCR are not only able but encouraged to join in the meetup discussions. These meetups are meant for education, innovation and critical discussion on topics in the blockchain and cryptocurrency space. The goal is to gather anyone at NCR interested in blockchain and crypto in one place to create a culture of learning, innovation and critical thinking around the topic. We want all who desire knowledge in this realm to participate! The ONLY requirement is a desire to learn!

### Meetup Types
1. Education 
   - Learn & Discuss is the theme.
   - Education meetups will be knowledge focused for anyone to learn about a topic.
   - Content will be less technical and catered to higher level ideas.
   - Format is a 20-30 min presentation followed by Q&A and discussion.
2. Innovation
   - Collaboration and ideation is the teme.
   - These meetups are meant to be like a shark tank.
   - We will allow anyone 5 minutes max to pitch ideas to the group and open it up to a 5 minute Q&A and discussion meant to "sharpen" the ideas and value propositions presented in the pitch.
   - The focus of the ideas should revolve around crypto and blockchain based ideas: especially as it relates to NCR customers.
   - A form will be sent out in advance to collect and rate ideas for pitching.
   - If your idea is chosen, you will be contacted to organize a pitch presentation.
3. Socratic
   - Critial thinking & healthy debate is the theme.
   - These meetups are typically a little more technical in nature (although they don't have to be).
   - In a typical socratic session, a moderator will send out some reading material beforehand that participants are required to read beforehand.
   - Attendees should formulate questions or thought provoking discussion points for the group.
   - The idea is to generate a fact based discussion to drive us closer to the "truth" of the topic and help each other gain a more in-depth understanding of the topic.
   - The moderator will do a quick, high level presenatation on the highlights of the reading material.
   - A platform for discussion is opened up to the whole group for questions, debate, discussion, etc. 
   - For reference, here is a definition of a socratic seminar:
       > A Socratic seminar is a type of formal group discussion based on the learning and teaching methods employed by Socrates, an
       > ancient Greek philosopher often credited with founding Western philosophy. It is based more on inquiry and discussion. Socrates
       > held the idea that it is more effective to help participants think for themselves than it is to simply give them information. A
       > Socratic seminar is, therefore, intended to be a discussion of a specific topic among all of those present rather than a
       > situation in which one teacher gives information to students.
